# SPACEX - DATA SCIENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT

𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
• Collected data from public SpaceX API 
and SpaceX Wikipedia page. Created labels column ‘class’ which 
classifies successful landings. Explored data using SQL, visualization, folium maps, a
nd dashboards. Gathered relevant columns to be used as features. Changed all cat
egorical variables to binary using one 
hot encoding. Standardized data and used GridSearchCV to find best parameters fo
r machine learning models. Visualize accuracy score of all models.
• Four machine learning 
models were produced: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree
Classifier, and K Nearest 
Neighbors. All produced similar results with accuracy rate of about 83.33%. All 
models over predicted successful landings. More data is needed for better model de
termination and accuracy.
