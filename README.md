# SPACEX - DATA SCIENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT

𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧

• 𝐂𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐩𝐮𝐛𝐥𝐢𝐜 𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐞𝐗 𝐀𝐏𝐈 
𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐞𝐗 𝐖𝐢𝐤𝐢𝐩𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐚 𝐩𝐚𝐠𝐞.Created labels column ‘class’ which 
classifies successful landings. Explored data using SQL, visualization, folium maps, a
nd dashboards. Gathered relevant columns to be used as features. Changed all cat
egorical variables to binary using one 
hot encoding. Standardized data and used GridSearchCV to find best parameters for machine learning models. 
Visualize accuracy score of all models.

• 𝐅𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐦𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐬 𝐰𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐞𝐝:
Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Classifier, and K Nearest 
Neighbors. All produced similar results with 𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐲 𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝟖𝟑.𝟑𝟑%. All 
models over predicted successful landings. More data is needed for better model determination and accuracy.

# METHODOLOGY

• 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲:
• Combined data from SpaceX public API and SpaceX 
Wikipedia page

• 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐰𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠

• Classifying true 
landings as successful and unsuccessful otherwise
• Perform exploratory data analysis(EDA) using visualization and SQL
• Perform interactive visual analytics using 𝐅𝐨𝐥𝐢𝐮𝐦 and 𝐏𝐥𝐨𝐭𝐥𝐲 𝐃𝐚𝐬𝐡
• Perform predictive analysis using classificationmodels
• Tuned models using 𝐆𝐫𝐢𝐝𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐂𝐕
