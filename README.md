𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐞𝐗 𝐖𝐢𝐤𝐢𝐩𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐚 𝐩𝐚𝐠𝐞.Created labels column ‘class’ which 
classifies successful landings. Explored data using SQL, visualization, folium maps, a
nd dashboards. Gathered relevant columns to be used as features. Changed all cat
egorical variables to binary using one 
hot encoding. Standardized data and used GridSearchCV to find best parameters for machine learning models. 
Visualize accuracy score of all models.

Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Classifier, and K Nearest 
Neighbors. All produced similar results with 𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐲 𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝟖𝟑.𝟑𝟑%. All 
models over predicted successful landings. More data is needed for better model determination and accuracy.
